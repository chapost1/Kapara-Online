in pursuance of  - angular app build --prod
located in the build folder( public ) of server application,
running is recommended through our nodejs express folder. 
looking at angular code itself is fine and recommended :).
Runing the app through kaparaOnline-server folder
and not throgh kaparaOnline-client is best.
